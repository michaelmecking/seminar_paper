\section{Citation}

Throughout the academic paper, the reader should always be able to clearly recognise which parts are
the author's thoughts, ideas or interpretations. 

All citation guidelines as well as guidelines for the listing of sources in the bibliography can be
found in the document \enquote{OU Harvard guide to citing references} of THI University
Library~\cite{THI23}. Spend the effort to make all citations complete and consistent. Do not just
copy random inconsistent BibTeX (or other) entries from the web and call it a day. Check over your
final bibliography carefully and make sure every entry looks right.~\cite{JW06} 

Especially for books, it is recommended that you not only provide a reference to the book
(e.g.,~\cite{BertGal92}) but additionally provide the specific page~\cite[p. 123]{Cov12}. All
references should be placed in a section at the end of the paper, but before the appendixes.

Plagiarism will affect the grade and, depending on the amount of copying, may lead to failure of the
module examination. Undeclared use of automatically generated text, e.g., using ChatGPT, is
considered plagiarism. Students reference automatically generated text like any other source,
marking it as a citation (use quotation marks if copied without editing). Students are responsible
for the quality of the generated text.
