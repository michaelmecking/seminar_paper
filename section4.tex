\section{Conclusions and Further Work} 

In the last chapter of your seminar paper, you should
\begin{itemize}
    \item summarise the core statements and findings of your paper,
    \item provide an outlook and state which crucial questions are still open or part of active
        research,  
    \item and what approaches are promising to make further progress in the future.
\end{itemize}
