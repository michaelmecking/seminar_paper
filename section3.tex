\section{Main Body} 

The main body should provide a detailed presentation of the assigned topic and your evaluation
concerning the usefulness. There is no guideline to the number of sections your main body comprises,
but \enquote{every section of the paper should tell a story. The story should be linear, keeping
the reader engaged at every step and looking forward to the next step. There should be no
significant interruptions -- those can go in the Appendix.}~\cite{JW06}
