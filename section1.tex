\section[Introduction]{The Long Introduction to My Seminar Paper}

The Introduction is crucially important. A casual reader will continue on if your introduction
captivated them, and will set the paper aside otherwise. According to~\cite{JW06}, the Introduction
should consist of five paragraphs answering the following questions:
\begin{itemize}
    \item What is the problem?
    \item Why is it interesting and important?
    \item Why is it hard? (E.g., why do naive approaches fail or are too complex?)
    \item Why hasn't it been solved before?
    \item What are the key components and results of the approach I am reporting on? 
\end{itemize}

The second part of the introductory chapter is a rough and short overview of the content of the
work. This is intended to give the reader a quick insight into the work so that they can perhaps
skip a few chapters and go straight to the part that interests them.
