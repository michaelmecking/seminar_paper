\section{Do's and Do Not's}

\begin{itemize}
    \item Always run a spell checker on your seminar paper. There are no excuses! Is is not the task
      of your supervisor to mark spelling mistakes, and papers which clearly violate this
      requirement will be rejected.
    \item English is (most likely) not the native language of the writer. There are helpful
      guidelines for the use of English grammar and scientific writing which are beneficial to apply
      and will improve any paper: see, e.g., \cite{IEEEstyleguide, Gol06} as well as the
      classic book~\cite{Stu12}.
    \item Please choose whether you would like to write your paper in British or American English.
      Do not mix the two languages.    
    \item Abbreviations should be initially introduced once (!) in the text, e.g., Machine Learning
      (ML). Later on, only the abbreviation ML should be reused. The seminar paper is not supposed
      to have an own section listing all used abbreviations.
\end{itemize}
