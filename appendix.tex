\section{Appendix}

According to~\cite{JW06}, \enquote{appendixes should contain algorithms, detailed proofs, or
derivations only.  Appendixes can be crucial for overlength papers, but are still useful otherwise.
Think of appendixes as random--access substantiation of underlying gory details.}

As a rule of thumb~\cite{JW06}:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Appendixes should not contain any material necessary for understanding the contributions of the paper.
    \item Appendixes should contain all material that most readers would not be interested in.
\end{itemize}
