\section*{Abstract} %% <= change to "Zusammenfassung" if written in German

The abstract serves to give the reader a rough overview of the content (brief problem definition, approach,
solution and possibly the key findings). Include little if any background and motivation. Be factual but
comprehensive. The material in the abstract should not be repeated later word for word in the paper. It
should be about half a page in length.
