\section{Related Work} 

This section after the introduction is intended to provide an overview of works on the topics
presented, which serve as additional motivation for the core topic of the seminar paper. 

The first step in any scientific investigation usually involves a thorough review of the available
literature. Your supervisor will have provided you with a small selection of references. A solid
scientific seminar paper should primarily consist of scientific literature such as journals,
conference reports, books, standardisation documents and, if applicable, white papers from
companies. A paper that is based on only two or three sources cannot be considered thoroughly
researched. This principle also applies to work that is based solely on standard textbooks.
Wikipedia or Google may provide a lot of information, but they are not considered scientific and
reliable sources - use use them either very little or preferably not at all.
